### Hey, I'm Khadeeja üëãüèº

  I'm 20, a curious CS major in Canada, and experimenting with expanding my skills using project-based learning :)
  
## ‚òïWhat am I doing?
  - Currently working on **LumosLearn**, a web development project built to practice skills in:
    - HTML/CSS/JS
    - Clean UI
    - Storage management (figuring out how JSON and Node.Js work)
    (It's a personal collaboration project too!)
  - Current working on **Thinkbox Notes**, a secure note-taking WebApp designed to be hosted locally to keep your thoughts private :)
    Skills:
    - Introduction to Web Application Security (risks like XSS, encryption etc)
    - Clean UI
    - Automated security testing
    - Later addition: offline AI integration:
      - Find sensitive words and decide privacy level - passwords: encryption, just ideas: password lock/no encryption
      - Filter notes in search more accurately
      - Summarize a selected note in chat (very basic summary using a lightweight model to ensure no data needs to be sent)
  - Improving my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms
    
## üíªLearning...
This is a list of tools and concepts I'm actively learning and working with
  - **Programming Languages** - `Python`, `Java`, `C/C++`
  - **Web Development** - `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript `, `Node.js`
  - **Version Control** - `Git`
  - **Other** - `React`, `Electron Apps`, `Shell Scripting`, `Bash`

These are the skills I practiced in courses
  - `Verilog`, `RISC-V Assembly`
  - `Visual Basic`

## üí≠Interested in learning...
I'm especially curious about platforms like AWS and Azure, and integrating AI API's into my projects to explore smart functionality.

## üï∏Ô∏èRandom things about me...
  - I have a lot of hobbies, including drawing, photography and anime
  - I'm learning **graphic design** on the side
  - I sell my artwork on products using print-on-demand services (I do custom ones too)
  - I'm into sports (Hiking, Badminton, Running)
  - I'm exploring a career path that blends **cybersecurity** and **development**.
  - I enjoy breaking down and explaining things I'm good at -it's one of the ways I learn best and help others.

## Always happy to say hello üòä
