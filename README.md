### Hey, I'm Khadeeja 👋🏼

  I'm 20, a curious CS major in Canada, and experimenting with expanding my skills using project-based learning :)

    - Clean UI
    - Storage management (figuring out how JSON and Node.Js work)
    (It's a personal collaboration project too!)
  - Improving my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a list of tools and concepts I'm actively learning and working with
  - **Programming Languages** - `Python`, `Java`, `C/C++`
  - **Web Development** - `HTML`, `CSS`, `Java Script `, `Node.js`
  - **Version Control** - `Git`

I'm especially curious about platforms like AWS and Azure, and integrating AI API's into my projects to explore smart functionality.

## 🕸️Random things about me...
  - I have a lot of hobbies, including drawing, photography and anime
